name: academic-search
description: Navigates academic literature, formulates search strategies, recommends databases, analyzes paper abstracts, explains methodologies, structures literature reviews, and identifies research gaps. Use this skill whenever the user mentions finding papers, academic search, research strategy, literature review, database search, citation chaining, PubMed, Google Scholar, or asks how to search for academic content on any topic. Also trigger when user is working on a thesis, dissertation, or needs to understand the research landscape on any subject.

# Academic Search

## Overview

I help you navigate academic literature, find relevant papers, understand research methodologies, and synthesize findings for your research projects or literature reviews.

**What I can do:**
- Formulate academic search queries
- Recommend databases and search strategies
- Analyze paper abstracts and summaries
- Explain research methodologies
- Help structure literature reviews
- Identify research gaps

**What I cannot do:**
- Access full-text papers (unless provided)
- Execute actual database searches
- Access paywalled journals
- Conduct original research

## How to Use Me

### Step 1: Define Your Research Topic

Tell me:
- Your research question or topic
- Academic field/discipline
- Scope (broad survey vs. specific topic)
- Purpose (literature review, thesis, curiosity)

### Step 2: Get Search Strategy

I'll provide:
- Optimized search queries
- Recommended databases
- Key terms and synonyms
- Search methodology

### Step 3: Analyze Findings

If you share papers/abstracts, I can:
- Summarize key findings
- Explain methodologies
- Identify themes and patterns
- Help organize citations

## Search Query Formulation

### Boolean Operators

```
AND: Both terms must appear
     "machine learning" AND healthcare

OR:  Either term can appear
     "deep learning" OR "neural network"

NOT: Exclude term
     climate change NOT politics

():  Group terms
     (AI OR "artificial intelligence") AND ethics
```

### Advanced Techniques

#### 1. PICO Framework (Medical/Health)
```
P - Population/Patient
I - Intervention
C - Comparison
O - Outcome

Example: "elderly patients" AND "exercise therapy" AND "cognitive function"
```

#### 2. Concept Mapping
```
Main Concept: Machine Learning in Education
├── Synonyms: AI, artificial intelligence, deep learning
├── Related: adaptive learning, intelligent tutoring
└── Applications: personalization, assessment, analytics

Query: ("machine learning" OR "artificial intelligence" OR "deep learning") 
       AND (education OR learning OR "tutoring system")
```

#### 3. Citation Chaining
```
Forward citation: Who cited this paper?
Backward citation: What did this paper cite?
→ Both methods help find related work
```

### Search Filters

| Filter | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Date range | Recent developments |
| Publication type | Review vs. empirical |
| Author | Expert's work |
| Journal | High-impact venues |
| Language | Specific language papers |

## Paper Analysis Framework

### Reading Strategy: Three-Pass Method

#### Pass 1: Survey (5-10 min)
- Read title, abstract, introduction
- Scan headings and figures
- Read conclusion
- **Outcome**: Decide if worth reading more

#### Pass 2: Understanding (30-60 min)
- Read carefully but skip proofs/details
- Note key points and questions
- Understand figures and tables
- **Outcome**: Grasp main contributions

#### Pass 3: Deep Dive (hours)
- Virtually re-implement the work
- Challenge every assumption
- Identify strengths and weaknesses
- **Outcome**: Expert-level understanding

### Critical Analysis Questions

| Aspect | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| Research Question | Is it clear? Important? Novel? |
| Methodology | Appropriate? Rigorous? Reproducible? |
| Results | Convincing? Statistically valid? |
| Limitations | Acknowledged? How severe? |
| Contribution | What's new? How significant? |

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with review articles** to understand the landscape
2. **Use citation chaining** - both forward and backward
3. **Check author profiles** for related work
4. **Set up alerts** for new papers on your topic
5. **Use reference managers** (Zotero, Mendeley)
6. **Read abstracts first** to filter efficiently
7. **Focus on recent + seminal** papers
